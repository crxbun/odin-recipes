            <h2>Ingredients for Broth</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>5-6 pounds</strong> of beef knuckles or leg bones</li>
                <li><strong>6 quarts</strong> cold water</li>
                <li><strong>2</strong> medium onions, <em>quartered</em></li>
                <li><strong>4-inch piece</strong> of fresh ginger, <em>halved lengthwise</em></li>
                <li><strong>2</strong> cinnamon sticks</li>
                <li><strong>1 tablespoon</strong> coriander seeds</li>
                <li><strong>1</strong> star anise</li>
                <li><strong>6</strong> whole cloves</li>
                <li><strong>1</strong> black cardamom pod</li>

                        Black cardamom is a member of the ginger family and is quite powerful.
                        You can buy it in Asian markets, but it can be hard to find. If you are
                        unable to find it, it is okay to omit this ingredient.

                <hr>
                <li><strong>1 1/2 tablespoon</strong> of salt</li>
                <li><strong>1/4 cup</strong> fish sauce</li>
                <li><strong>1-inch piece</strong> yellow rock sugar</li>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    <small>
                        This is also known as "lump sugar" and is sold at Asian markets. Look
                        for it sold in a box. You will most likely need to <strong>break the rock
                        sugar into chunks</strong>. You can use a hammer or rolling pin to do this.

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <h3>Broth</h3>
                <li>Add beef bones to a large pot that will hold <em>at least 10 quarts</em>. Then, cover 
                    bones with cold water. Place pot onto <strong>high heat</strong> and bring to a boil. 
                    Boil for <strong>3 to 5 minutes</strong>. During this time, impurities and foam (or scum) 
                    will be released and rise to the top. Drain bones, discarding the water. Then, rinse bones with 
                    warm water and scrub stockpot to remove any residue that has stuck to the sides. Add the bones back 
                    to the stockpot and cover with <strong>6 quarts</strong> of cold water.
                </li>

                <hr>

                <li>
                    Meanwhile, move an oven rack to a high position then turn broiler to <strong>high</strong>. Line a baking sheet with 
                    aluminum foil. Place <strong>quartered onions and halved ginger</strong> onto baking sheet then <em>broil for 10 to 15 minutes</em>, 
                    turning onions and ginger occasionally so that they become charred or browned on all sides.
                </li>

                <hr>

                <li>
                    Add cinnamon sticks, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, star anise, cloves and the black cardamom 
                    pod to a <em>dry frying pan</em>. Place onto <strong>low heat</strong> and cook, stirring occasionally until fragrant. About 
                    5 minutes. Place toasted spices into a cotton muslin bag/herb sachet or cheesecloth then tie with 
                    butchers twine to seal.
                </li>

                <hr>

                <li>
                    Bring stockpot with parboiled bones and water to a <strong>boil</strong> then <strong>lower to a gentle simmer</strong>. 
                    Add charred onion and ginger as well as the bag or sachet of toasted spices. Add <strong>1 1/2</strong> 
                    tablespoons of salt, a <strong>1/4</strong> cup of fish sauce and the rock sugar. Continue to simmer broth, 
                    uncovered, for <strong>3 hours</strong>. If at any time foam or scum rises to the surface, use a spoon to remove it.
                </li>

                <hr>
                
                <li>
                    Use tongs or a wide mesh spoon to remove bones, onion and ginger from broth then strain broth 
                    through a fine mesh strainer. The broth will have a layer of fat at the the top. There are two 
                    ways to remove this. First, if you plan to enjoy the broth now, skim the fat from the top of the 
                    broth using a spoon. If you do not mind waiting, you can also pour broth into containers then refrigerate 
                    overnight. As the broth cools, the fat will solidify, making it very easy to remove.
                </li>

                <h3>Assembly</h3>
                <li>Bring the broth to a gentle simmer over medium heat.</li>
                
                <hr>

                <li>
                    If you are using dried noodles, add noodles to a bowl then cover with hot water and soak for 15 to 
                    20 minutes until soft and opaque. If you are using fresh, add to a colander then rinse with cold water.
                </li>

                <hr>

                <li>
                    To cook the noodles, bring a <strong>medium saucepan filled with water</strong> to a boil. Place noodles into boiling water 
                    and cook for about 10 seconds or until they collapse. Drain noodles then divide between bowls. (We like to 
                    fill each bowl by <strong>1/3</strong> with noodles).
                </li>

                <hr>

                <li>
                    Arrange slices of raw meat into bowls, and then top with the hot broth. Finish broth with onion slices 
                    and cilantro. Serve bowls with a plate of optional garnishes listed above.
